# Venmo-text-and-emoji-analytics
    Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app owned by PayPal. The Venmo app allows its users to exchange money with just a click of a button. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth, and its user-base had more than 40 million active accounts. What made Venmo so popular in the US is its social flavor; users are required to accompany their transactions with a message describing what the transaction was about. This social twist has allowed Venmo to transform financial transactions into sharing experiences. In this project, we are to answer some questions related to text analysis and social network analysis. 
## Objective
     1. Using the text and  emoji dictionary classify Venmo’s transactions in your sample dataset.
     2. Answer questions like%
        - What is the percent of emoji only transactions? 
        - Which are the top 5 most popular emoji? 
        - Which are the top three most popular emoji categories?
     3. For each user, create a variable to indicate their spending behavior profile. 
     4. Explore how a user’s spending profile is evolving over her lifetime in Venmo.
